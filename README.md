# RE-Assist
  RE-Assist is an application to replace the paper list directory in care planning and satisfies the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule. Our application can be used at the bedside or remotely by phone or tablet. RE-Assist allows patients/families to take more controlof the care planning process through clinical recomendations, to filter and choose providers by location, reviews and insurance. This allows patients to make educated decions on provider selection and truly alloows for an educated choice of providers. Ultimately, with the RE-Assist technology we bring accountablity to providers, knowlege of provider services to patients and clear messaging to accout managers. This will lead to reduction of readmissions, reducing length of stay, increasing utilization between providers, reduction of unporductivity and increasing patient satifaction. On the back end, there is trending, tracking, and quantifiable data to help identify patient barriers to provide more knowlege of potential resources.
