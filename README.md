# RE-Assist
RE-Assist is an application to replace the paper list directory in care planning and satisfies the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule. Our application can be used at the bedside or remotely by phone or tablet. RE-Assist allows patients/families to take more control of the care planning process through clinical recommendations, to filter and choose providers by location, reviews and insurance. This allows patients to make educated decisions on provider selection and truly allows for an educated choice of providers. Ultimately, with the RE-Assist technology we bring accountability to providers, knowledge of provider services to patients and clear messaging to account managers. This will lead to reduction of readmissions, reducing length of stay, increasing utilization between providers, reduction of unproductivity and increasing patient satisfaction. On the back end, there is trending, tracking, and quantifiable data to help identify patient barriers to provide more knowledge of potential resources.
